## Running project
This project is meant to run completely and totally within Docker.
To do so, make sure Docker is running on your machine,
and that you have all the requisite tools.

Run `docker-compose up`, or `docker-compose up -d` to not see logs.
The containers will all run simultaneously, notwithstanding any bugs.
